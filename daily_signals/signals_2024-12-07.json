    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears to be bullish for the majority of the ETFs analyzed. Most signals indicate a \"HOLD\" recommendation, with the moving average crossovers trending positively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) values are neutral but trending towards overbought, which may hint at a potential pullback. The low volatility across the board suggests a stable market environment, although one ETF displays weakness leading to a \"SELL\" signal.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: **HOLD**. The bullish moving average crossover and stable price action suggest maintaining current positions.\n  \n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: **HOLD**. Similar to VOO, the ETF shows bullish indicators and a steady upward trend. Keep positions as they are.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: **HOLD**.

The ETF shows bearish signals, including a moving average crossover in the negative direction, indicating potential further declines. It is advisable to exit this position.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **Overbought Conditions**: While most ETFs exhibit bullish trends, RSI values around 64-66 suggest nearing overbought territory. This could pose a risk of pullbacks, especially in volatile conditions.\n- **SOXL Risks**: The \"SELL\" signal indicates a potential downturn in the semiconductor sector. Investors should closely monitor this position and consider exiting to prevent further losses.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **For VOO**: Watch for support at the MA long of approximately **536.50** and resistance near the **558.82** close price.\n- **For SSO**: Attention at the MA long of **92.72** for support and the close price of **99.73** as resistance.\n- **For UPRO**: Support at **89.60**, resistance at **99.48**.\n- **For QQQ**: Support at **497.19**, resistance at **526.48**.\n- **For QLD**: Key levels are a support at **103.86** and resistance at **115.33**.\n- **For TQQQ**: Look to the MA long of **75.55** for support, and resistance at **87.74**.\n- **For SOXL**: Watch the support level at **33.14**; clear resistance lies above the current close price of **29.61**.\n\nIn conclusion, investors are recommended to continue holding positions in strong ETFs while monitoring specifics for the SOXL investment closely for necessary adjustments."
