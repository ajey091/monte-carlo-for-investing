    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market signals indicate a predominately neutral to bullish sentiment across major ETFs and leveraged ETFs, with most indicators maintaining a \"HOLD\" signal. The average volatility across these assets is low, suggesting stability in the current market. However, SOXL is showing a \"SELL\" signal, indicating potential weakness in that sector, specifically the semiconductor space.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Stable close price, above moving averages, bullish moving average cross. RSI indicates neutrality.\n  \n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Similar bullish indicators compared to VOO, with both moving averages suggesting upward movement. RSI is neutral, but close to key price levels.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: The moving averages indicate bullish momentum, with close prices above both short and long-term averages. Watch volatility.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Indicator signals are bullish with a rising price, pure stability is indicated by low volatility. RSI slightly above neutral.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Good price action with bullish moving averages, similar to QQQ. Monitor RSI for changes towards overbought territory.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Bullish moving average cross and a stable price rise supports this hold recommendation.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**: \n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: The price action is under both moving averages, bearish cross, and weak RSI signal indicate disappointing performance in the semiconductor sector.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **SOXL**: Being rated to \"SELL\" represents significant risk; consider exiting or reducing exposure to this leveraged ETF.\n- **General Risk**: Overreliance on low volatility could lead to complacency; remain vigilant to market disruptions or economic indicators that may suggest a change in trend.\n  \n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch $543.83 (short MA) and $541.71 (long MA) for support.\n- **SSO**: Key levels around $95.08 (short MA) and $94.48 (long MA) are critical for direction.\n- **UPRO**: Monitor $92.83 (short MA) and $92.04 (long MA) to identify reversal points.\n- **QQQ**: Watch the level of $509.91 (short MA) and $506.79 (long MA) for signs of bullish continuation or reversal.\n- **QLD**: Key levels around $108.83 (short MA) and $107.69 (long MA).\n- **TQQQ**: Watch for breakout or breakdown at $80.46 (short MA) and $79.30 (long MA).\n- **SOXL**: Watch closely at $30.47 (short MA) and $31.56 (long MA) for signs to potentially exit or reassess positions.\n\nIn conclusion, maintain a cautious stance focused on holding most positions with particular attention on SOXL, and keep a keen eye on key support and resistance levels as market conditions evolve."
