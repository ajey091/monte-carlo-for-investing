    "summary": "### Market Sentiment Summary:\nThe current market sentiment appears to be neutral with a slight bullish inclination across most major ETFs represented here. All ETFs except for SOXL are signaling to hold, indicating a stable environment with potential for moderate growth. SOXL, on the other hand, is showing weakness and is advised to sell, suggesting a divergence in the semiconductor sector compared to broader market trends.\n\n### Specific Recommendations:\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** MA cross is bullish with low volatility. The RSI is neutral, implying no strong overbought or oversold conditions.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** Bullish indicators and low volatility suggest stability with potential for upward movement.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** Bullish momentum in moving averages underpins the decision to hold, as does low volatility.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** Similar to VOO, QQQ has a bullish MA cross and neutral RSI, suggesting stability with potential for growth.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** The indicators show bullish signals while maintaining low volatility.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Hold.\n   - **Rationale:** Despite low RSI, indicators remain bullish; however, caution due to near-term volatility levels.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** This ETF exhibits bearish indicators with selling pressure noted through the moving averages and increased volatility compared to others.\n\n### Risk Warnings:\n- **SOXL**: The bearish signal and the sell recommendation highlight significant risk in the semiconductor sector, which is often more volatile than the broader market.\n- **TQQQ** and **QLD**: As leveraged ETFs, they carry inherent risks due to amplified exposure; market pullbacks can result in sharper losses.\n- The overall low volatility across the other ETFs suggests a lack of strong momentum; market events could rapidly change this environment.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch:\n- **Support Levels**:\n   - VOO: Watching around the recent MA levels (~548).\n   - QQQ: Key support is at MA levels near 516-519.\n   - For SOXL: Watch for potential support around 25-27, as a drop below could trigger selling pressure.\n\n- **Resistance Levels**:\n   - VOO: Resistance potentially near 558.\n   - QQQ: Key resistance could be seen above 525.\n   - TQQQ: Levels around 85-86 could act as resistance.\n\nMaintain close monitoring of economic indicators and sector performance, particularly for SOXL, which could determine earlier actions on potential rebounds or continued declines."
