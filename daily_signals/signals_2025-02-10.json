    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current trading signals for ETFs indicate a neutral sentiment across the market. While all analyzed ETFs are on a \"HOLD\" signal, their indicators reflect a generally bullish trend with low volatility. The relative strength indexes (RSIs) are close to the neutral zone (around 50), suggesting that market momentum is not strongly bullish or bearish at this time.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: The short moving average is higher than the long moving average (MA cross: BULLISH), indicating a possible upward trend. Maintain current positions as the market is stable.\n   - **Key Levels**: Watch for a breach of the MA support levels around 549.63 (short) and 548.61 (long).\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: Similar to VOO, SSO shows bullish MA cross and low volatility. Position should be maintained as the market remains relatively stable.\n   - **Key Levels**: Monitor support levels of 96.22 (short) and 96.02 (long) for any breakouts.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: The ETF is holding firm despite being slightly below its short-term MA. Continue to hold as it reflects positive MA trends.\n   - **Key Levels**: Key levels are 93.99 (short) and 93.78 (long).\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: The market has been stable with bullish MA signals. Holding is advisable as the ETF lingers within a good support and resistance range.\n   - **Key Levels**: Key support at 520.87 (short) and 517.84 (long).\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: Similar signals to QQQ, with bullish trends. It\u2019s prudent to maintain positions.\n   - **Key Levels**: Watch levels at 112.31 (short) and 111.23 (long).\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: The position reflects a cautious but stable holding. Stay put under the current market conditions.\n   - **Key Levels**: Look for support at 83.61 (short) and 82.53 (long).\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Insights**: Despite being the weakest performer with the lowest RSI, the bullish MA cross offers hope for recovery. Hold but stay cautious.\n   - **Key Levels**: Monitoring key support levels of 29.14 (short) and 28.93 (long) is necessary.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **General Risk**: As all signals are \"HOLD\" with neutral market momentum, it\u2019s essential to be prepared for potential volatility should market conditions shift.\n- **Leveraged ETF Risk**: Particularly with leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL, the risk is magnified due to their design to amplify returns. A sudden market downturn could lead to significant losses. Manage positions and consider stop-loss orders.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**:\n  - VOO: 549.63 (short), 548.61 (long)\n  - SSO: 96.22 (short), 96.02 (long)\n  - UPRO: 93.99 (short), 93.78 (long)\n  - QQQ: 520.87 (short), 517.84 (long)\n  - QLD: 112.31 (short), 111.23 (long)\n  - TQQQ: 83.61 (short), 82.53 (long)\n  - SOXL: 29.14 (short), 28.93 (long)\n\nIn summary, the current market remains stable with a neutral sentiment. Investors should maintain current positions, monitor key support levels, and be mindful of the risks associated with leveraged ETFs."
