    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is cautiously bearish for a majority of the ETFs analyzed, particularly those focused on broader market indices and leveraged strategies. The bearish signals in VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500), and UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500) suggest potential weakness in the underlying assets. However, there are some bullish signals for certain leveraged ETFs like QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ) and TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ), indicating some optimism particularly in tech-sector indices.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: The bearish moving average crossover and a neutral RSI suggest weakening momentum. It may be prudent to exit positions or short this ETF.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: Similar to VOO, the bearish signal indicates a lack of upward momentum. Consider closing positions.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: Given the consensus from the bearish indicators, it is advisable to sell or short this position to mitigate losses.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: A bullish moving average crossover suggests potential for price strength. Consider maintaining positions.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: The bullish indicators here indicate some strength in the tech sector. Holding is recommended, with a close watch for signs of strength.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Similar to QLD, bullish indicators suggest the potential for further gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Continue holding positions.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: A neutral RSI coupled with a bullish moving average crossover suggests stabilization. Maintain positions with caution.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **General Market Risks**: The bearish signals from several major ETFs indicate heightened risk and potential downward movement in equity markets. Caution is warranted particularly regarding any leveraged ETFs due to their heightened sensitivity to market movements.\n- **Volatility**: With low to moderate volatility currently observed, any negative catalyst (e.g., economic data, earnings reports) could lead to increased price volatility, especially in leveraged ETFs.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **For VOO**: Monitor the support level around the short-term moving average of $550. A break below this could escalate bearish sentiment.\n- **For SSO and UPRO**: Watch for support around their respective moving averages around $96 (SSO) and $94 (UPRO).\n- **For QQQ**: Watch closely for movements above $540 for bullish reinforcement.\n- **For QLD and TQQQ**: The levels around $112 for QLD and $84 for TQQQ are pivotal. Maintaining above these levels could indicate potential rallying points.\n- **For SOXL**: Keep an eye on the price around $28, as it could dictate further direction.\n\nOverall, staying vigilant and adjusting positions based on the evolving market structure is crucial at this time."
