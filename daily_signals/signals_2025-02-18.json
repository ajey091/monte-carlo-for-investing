    "summary": "### Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is mixed to bearish for most ETFs analyzed, indicating a potential downturn in stock prices. While some of the leveraged ETFs retain bullish indicators, the overall recommendation is to be cautious. The presence of bearish signals in key ETFs like VOO, SSO, and UPRO suggests that traders might consider locking in profits or reassessing their positions.\n\n### Specific Recommendations\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Action**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: The crossover indicates a bearish trend, and the RSI is nearing overbought levels. It may be prudent to take profits now.\n     \n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Action**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: Similarly, the bearish MA cross and lower RSI indicate further downside potential. A sell action is recommended to manage risk.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n   - **Action**: SELL\n   - **Rationale**: This leveraged ETF aligns with the bearish signals present in the underlying index (S&P 500). A sell to reduce exposure is advisable.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Action**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Although it shows a bullish MA cross, opting to hold while monitoring volatility is recommended for this tech-heavy ETF.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Action**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Similar to QQQ, QLD indicates positive momentum. Holding is advisable as long as the bullish trend continues without signs of reversal.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Action**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Retaining bullish indicators, this leveraged ETF may benefit from continued upward momentum in tech stocks. Maintain positions cautiously.\n   \n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Action**: HOLD\n   - **Rationale**: Maintaining a hold strategy is recommended due to neutral indicators. However, with increased volatility, on-watch is crucial for adjustments.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- The bearish signals in multiple key ETFs suggest heightened risk for long positions. Be vigilant about overall market sentiment and consider implementing stop-loss orders.\n- Leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and QLD can amplify losses in a declining market, making it essential to actively monitor performance.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch key support at $550 and resistance at around $570.\n- **SSO**: Monitor support near $95 and resistance around $105.\n- **UPRO**: Key support at $93 and resistance around $100.\n- **QQQ**: Key support at $520 and resistance at $550.\n- **QLD**: Support at $112 and resistance at around $125.\n- **TQQQ**: Support around $84 and resistance at $90.\n- **SOXL**: Support near $28 and potential resistance level at $30.\n\nContinue to actively reassess these positions based on market movements, especially with the indicators showing mixed signals."
