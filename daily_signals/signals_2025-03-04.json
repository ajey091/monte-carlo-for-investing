    "summary": "## Current Market Analysis Summary\n\n### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe market is currently exhibiting a bearish sentiment, as all analyzed ETFs (including both standard and leveraged) are issuing \"SELL\" signals. The moving average crossovers are consistently bearish across all instruments, suggesting that short-term price movements are lagging behind long-term trends. The RSI values are hovering between-neutral and oversold, indicating a lack of upward momentum and potential for further downside.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: Significant distance from moving averages, weak relative strength indicated by RSI below 45.\n  \n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: Bearish indicators are aligned, with a closing price much lower than short and long-term MA.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: RSI indicates weakness, coupled with moving averages that suggest continued bearish momentum.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: Similar bearish crossover and RSI readings indicate vulnerability to continued declines.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: Strong distance from MAs reinforces bearish outlook with little upward strength.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: Consistent with other tech ETFs, moving averages indicate bearishness and declining momentum.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Sell\n  - **Rationale**: It shows the lowest RSI value among the listed ETFs, indicating oversold conditions. The volatility is higher, suggesting higher risk.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **Market Volatility**: All ETFs are exhibiting low to moderate volatility, but leveraged ETFs like SOXL and TQQQ are inherently riskier due to their amplified moves. Be cautious of significant drawdowns in turbulent market conditions.\n- **Potential for Short-Selling**: Shorting the market through these sell signals may result in losses if there is a sudden reversal. Monitor market trends closely.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**: Monitor the previous lows around the current close prices for each ETF to gauge potential areas of support.\n  - **VOO**: Watch for support near $530\n  - **SSO**: Watch around $85\n  - **UPRO**: Target support near $80\n  - **QQQ**: Watch for $490\n  - **QLD**: Monitor support near $95\n  - **TQQQ**: Key level to watch is $65\n  - **SOXL**: Look for support near $18\n  \nIn summary, the current bearish market conditions suggest caution, particularly with leveraged ETFs. Investors should consider reducing exposure and preparing for potential market corrections."
