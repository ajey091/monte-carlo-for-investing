    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe market is currently exhibiting a bearish sentiment across multiple ETFs, indicated by selling signals and various technical indicators such as the death cross in moving averages (MA Cross) and oversold conditions (RSI below 40). Low volatility levels suggest that market movements are muted, but the overall trend is negative, indicating potential continued weakness in the near term.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $529.51\n   - **Key Levels:** Watch the support around $525. If it breaks below, further downside may be significant.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $87.99\n   - **Key Levels:** Identify support at $85. A break below this level could signal increased selling pressure.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $81.39\n   - **Key Levels:** Monitor for resistance around $82.50; a failure to regain this level could lead to further declines.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $491.79\n   - **Key Levels:** Key support is at $490. A breach could lead to a further test of lower support levels.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $98.36\n   - **Key Levels:** Watch for support at $96. A dip below this could invoke panic selling.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $67.41\n   - **Key Levels:** Key resistance is at $70. A failure to push above this level is likely to reinforce bearish sentiment.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Strong Sell\n   - **Current Price:** $20.88\n   - **Key Levels:** Critical support lies at $20. A sustained drop below this range could indicate further weakness.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- All analyzed ETFs are issuing SELL signals, which indicates significant risk for holders. Short-term traders need to be cautious as further price declines could result in amplified losses due to leverage, particularly in those ETFs that utilize leverage (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL).\n- It\u2019s important to be aware of broader market events or news that could exacerbate volatility and trigger swift price movements.\n  \n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels:** Indicated key support areas are critical to monitor. Breaking these may lead to increased selling pressure and extended declines.\n- **Resistance Levels:** For potential trend reversal signals, monitor resistance marked for each ETF. A failed attempt to reclaim these levels may confirm continued bearish momentum.\n  \nIn summary, transitioning into a more defensive position may be advisable considering current signals, particularly for leveraged ETFs, where risks can magnify quickly. Implementing stop-loss strategies can help protect against unforeseen market swings."
