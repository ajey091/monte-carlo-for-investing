    "summary": "### Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the majority of the trading signals for both leveraged ETFs and standard ETFs. Most assets show oversold conditions, but this does not translate into strong bullish momentum due to bearish signals in moving averages and general market sentiment. \n\n### ETF Recommendations\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **BUY**. The bullish MA cross amidst oversold conditions may indicate a potential reversal. However, it\u2019s crucial to monitor closely for confirmation before committing significant capital.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at 545.75 (short MA) and support around the recent closing price.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Bearish MA cross and oversold RSI suggest further downside potential. Consider exiting positions to mitigate losses.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around 94.17 (short MA) for possible reversal points.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Similar bearish signals as SSO, with a strong MA cross to the downside. Suggest exiting positions.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Watch for resistance at 90.63 (short MA).\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Oversold conditions in conjunction with bearish MA signals indicate further decline is likely. Exit positions if not already done.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around 515.06 (short MA).\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Bearish conditions with no support visible. Avoid holding positions.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance seen at 108.92 (short MA).\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Given the consistent bearish indicators, maintaining or adding to positions would not be advisable.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance near 79.36 (short MA).\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation:** **SELL**. Although the volatility is higher, the bearish signals suggest further declines. \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around 26.79 (short MA).\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Increased Volatility:** Particularly in leveraged ETFs (e.g., SOXL, TQQQ), which have a higher sensitivity to market moves. Prolonged bearish trends can lead to significant losses.\n- **Market Conditions:** If the overall market continues to decline, leveraged ETFs may face amplified losses due to their inherent volatility and leverage.\n\n### Conclusion\nInvestors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and market outlook before acting on these recommendations. While VOO shows signs of potential recovery, most other ETFs signal continued bearish trends, urging a cautious approach in the current market environment."
