    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment reflects significant bearishness across several key ETFs, especially leveraged ETFs, as indicated by multiple sell signals and oversold conditions. The RSI values for most leveraged instruments are below 40, suggesting a lack of buying momentum. VOO is showing some signs of bullishness with a hold rating but remains in a neutral position overall with low volatility. \n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Signal**: HOLD\n   - **Recommendation**: Maintain current positions. The bullish MA cross indicates possible price recovery, though with a low RSI (38.45), caution is advised.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Monitor if the price can regain its moving averages (short: 543.04, long: 542.66).\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Close positions to limit losses. The bearish MA cross and oversold RSI (37.11) signal a downward trend.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Watch for signs of recovery; the previous high near 93.08 should be monitored as resistance. \n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Close positions due to bearish trends. With an RSI of 36.56, the potential for further declines is high.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Look at 88.98 and 89.05 as significant resistance points.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Exit positions as it shows strong bearish signals. Shares are oversold (RSI of 37.73) and should be monitored closely.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance will be found at around 510.63 (the short MA).\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Close positions immediately. The bearish outlook is supported by both MA cross and timing.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Pay attention to the resistance at 106.84.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Exit all holdings. The bearish momentum is clear with low RSI (35.98).\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Key resistance at around 76.99 should be noted.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Close positions as the upside is not favorable with bearish signals brightening up the picture (RSI at 40.33).\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Watch resistance around 25.53.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Market Volatility**: The current volatility is low but still presents opportunities for swings. However, leverage increases risk exposure\u2014especially on downturns, as amplified moves can significantly impact portfolio values.\n- **Economic Conditions**: Should broader economic indicators shift (such as interest rates or GDP growth), these ETFs could respond unpredictably.\n\nMaintaining awareness of underlying economic trends is crucial as they can exacerbate or alleviate current bearish trends in the ETFs discussed. Monitoring closely for any market recovery signs or reversal indicators will be prudent for positioning future trades."
