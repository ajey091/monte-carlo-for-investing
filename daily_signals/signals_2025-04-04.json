    "summary": "### Market Summary\n\nAs of April 3, 2025, the current market sentiment is distinctly **bearish**. All analyzed ETFs\u2014including **VOO**, **QQQ**, **SSO**, **UPRO**, **QLD**, **TQQQ**, and **SOXL**\u2014are signaling a **SELL**. Indicators reveal strong oversold conditions across these ETFs, as reflected by their low RSI values. Moreover, the moving average cross of shorter-term moving averages below longer-term moving averages further supports the bearish outlook. While volatility is classified as low for most, it is notable that TQQQ and SOXL exhibit higher volatility, indicating potential risk for investors.\n\n### Specific Recommendations\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** With an RSI of 33.82 and bearish MA cross, a sale is advisable to minimize losses and preserve capital.\n\n2. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** Consistency in bearish indicators; consider reducing exposure to avoid further declines as RSI sits at 32.18.\n\n3. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** Reinforces the need to pivot to a more defensive stance, particularly as its short-term and long-term MAs are both bearish.\n\n4. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** Same sentiment applied here, given RSIs below 33.0 and MA variables indicating a continual downtrend.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** Oversold conditions warrant cautious action; consider divesting.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** Higher volatility could lead to greater risk and make this a candidate for divestment as RSI is significantly low at 30.42.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** SELL  \n   - **Remark:** With the lowest RSI at 28.34, immediate action may be warranted here, especially given the high volatility observed.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n\n- The low RSI suggests that the assets are oversold; however, it does not indicate a reversal is imminent. Exercise caution during this time as further declines may occur before any recovery.\n- Although volatility is low for VOO, QQQ, SSO, UPRO, QLD, and TQQQ, be aware that SOXL and TQQQ exhibit increased risk due to higher volatility, which can amplify losses.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n\n- **Support Levels:** \n  - Monitor for potential support at significant historical lows for each ETF; these levels can act as a pivot point for potential rebounds.\n  \n- **Resistance Levels:**\n  - Keep an eye on the short- and long-term moving averages as resistance levels, as they provide insight into where price reversals may occur if conditions change.\n\nGiven this market analysis, the overall strategy should prioritize risk management, including diversifying into assets with stronger fundamentals or maintaining cash positions to capitalize on future opportunities when market conditions stabilize."
