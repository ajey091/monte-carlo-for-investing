    "summary": "### Current Market Situation Summary\n\nAs of April 4, 2025, the overall market sentiment is **bearish**, with multiple ETFs signaling \"SELL\". All major indicators, such as moving average crossovers and RSI (Relative Strength Index), confirm an oversold condition, but the consistent `SELL` signals across various ETFs indicate a prevailing bearish trend.

Risk Warnings\n- **High Volatility:** While the current volatility is low across all ETFs, it's important to note that leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL can experience high levels of volatility in response to market shifts, leading to amplified gains or losses.\n- **Oversold Conditions:** The \"OVERSOLD\" status may set the stage for a short-term bounce; however, given the bearish signals, this could be a trap for buyers. Investors should be cautious about trying to time the market.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels:** Identify the key support levels as they may act as crucial points for potential rebounds. The levels mentioned above are key areas where prices may stabilize.\n- **Resistance Levels:** Keep an eye on resistance levels as potential targets for any future upward moves before considering re-entering. These levels indicate where selling pressure may emerge again.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the current landscape indicates a dominant bearish trend across the analyzed ETFs, with consistent selling signals. Investors are advised to adopt a defensive strategy, reducing exposure to these ETFs and remaining vigilant about market shifts."
