    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears to be bearish as signaled by all analyzed ETFs (VOO, SSO, UPRO, QQQ, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL) indicating a \"SELL\" signal. The short-term moving averages are below the long-term moving averages for each asset, and their Relative Strength Index (RSI) values are trending towards oversold or neutral levels, suggesting weakness and a lack of buyer interest.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** Both short and long moving averages are bearish, with the price significantly below both. The RSI is at 40.93, not indicating an immediate reversal.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** Similar to VOO, SSO shows a bearish crossover and the price is well below moving averages. Its RSI is below 40, suggesting weak momentum.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** The asset shows a bearish trend with prices below moving averages and a low RSI of 38.06 indicating a potential continued downtrend.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** The bearish indicators are present, highlighted by the price under both moving averages and an RSI of 42.43, indicating further weakness.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** QLD is conforming to the bearish trend, with a close price well below moving averages. A low RSI also confirms bearish momentum.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** Like the others, TQQQ is influenced by bearish signals with a low RSI of 39.13 being indicative of weakness.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell.\n   - **Rationale:** SOXL shows a bearish setup with a higher level of volatility (0.150) compared to other ETFs. Although the RSI is at 37.09 and marked as oversold, caution is needed due to its high volatility.\n\n### Risk Warnings\nInvestors should be cautious, especially when dealing with leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) as they tend to amplify both gains and losses. Given the bearish sentiment across the board, these assets could experience heightened volatility and may incur larger losses if the market continues to decline.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels:** Watch for potential support levels that could provide a reversal if the prices approach them, particularly:\n  - VOO: Near the latest closing price around $490.\n  - QQQ: Monitoring the $450 level for potential support.\n  - SOXL: Attention to price movements around $10 could yield significant implications.\n\n- **Resistance Levels:** If any of these assets start to recover, watch for resistance at their short-term and long-term moving averages, which are:\n  - VOO: $525 (short-term) and $530 (long-term).\n  - QQQ: $490 (short-term) and $496 (long-term).\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment was negative across all ETFs, with each suggesting positioning away from exposure until clearer bullish signals appear."
