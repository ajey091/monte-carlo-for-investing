    "summary": "### Current Market Sentiment\n\nThe current market sentiment for the analyzed ETFs is primarily bearish. All the provided ETFs signal a \"SELL\" based on several technical indicators. The bearish moving average cross indicates a negative trend, and while the RSI levels suggest that the market is neutrally positioned, the volatility readings are low across the board. This suggests a lack of momentum in either direction, which often prefaces a consolidation phase or further downside movement.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at previous highs (~519), support around ~480.\n \n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at around ~85, support near ~70.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at around ~78, support near ~56.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at previous highs (~490), support near ~440.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at around ~96, support around ~75.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at ~64, support around ~44.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation:** SELL\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at around ~19.2, support at ~8.5.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n\n- Leveraged ETFs, such as SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL, are particularly risky due to their magnified exposure. The technical indicators suggest a weak market, making them more susceptible to sharp reversals. Holding these positions can lead to significant losses if the market continues to decline.\n- Investors should closely monitor volatility indicators, as a sudden increase could lead to dramatic price movements.\n- Given the low RSI readings in SOXL, caution is advised as it may be oversold, but potential further downside exists.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n\nMonitoring key resistance and support levels is essential:\n- **Resistance Levels:** Closely observed previous highs where traders may exit their positions or short the market.\n- **Support Levels:** Areas where buying interest may return, potentially mitigating further declines. If price breaks below these levels, additional selling could ensue.\n\n### Summary \n\nIn conclusion, the market sentiment is bearish, and all analyzed ETFs signal a \"SELL\" based on current technical indicators. Investors should proceed with caution, especially with leveraged ETFs, and monitor key support and resistance levels to inform their trading strategies."
