    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the selling signals across multiple ETFs. All reported ETFs (VOO, SSO, UPRO, QQQ, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) show bearish moving average crosses and neutral RSI values. Low volatility conditions support the argument for a potential consolidation phase, but overall, investor sentiment appears to be cautious and leaning towards selling.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Closing below both short and long moving averages indicates a bearish trend.\n  \n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Similar to VOO, the bearish cross and proximity to key moving averages suggest continued downside.\n  \n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Bearish trend indicated by falling below moving averages; potential for further declines.\n  \n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Close to long-term moving average but showing a bearish crossover; caution advised.\n  \n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Falling short of both moving averages suggests ongoing bearish sentiment.\n  \n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Continued bearish signals warrant exiting positions, especially with low RSI.\n  \n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Action**: SELL\n  - **Rationale**: Significantly below moving averages and highly volatile; exit positions to mitigate risk.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- Trading leveraged ETFs (like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL) carries additional risks due to their amplified nature. If the market continues to move against these positions, losses can intensify. \n- Ensure to monitor market developments closely, as volatility may increase, exposing investors to downside risk quickly.\n- The current low RSI across all ETFs suggests caution, as it may indicate a potential for subsequent rebounds after further sell-offs, but bear in mind the overarching bearish sentiment.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch resistance at $512.99 (short MA) and $520.37 (long MA).\n- **SSO**: Key resistance levels at $82.54 (short MA) and $85.23 (long MA).\n- **UPRO**: Resistance at $73.70 (short MA) and $77.60 (long MA).\n- **QQQ**: Key levels at $476.10 (short MA) and $485.46 (long MA).\n- **QLD**: Critical resistance at $91.81 (short MA) and $95.92 (long MA).\n- **TQQQ**: Resistance levels at $60.36 (short MA) and $64.85 (long MA).\n- **SOXL**: Monitor levels at $17.29 (short MA) and $19.11 (long MA).\n\n**Conclusion**: Caution is advised in this bearish environment, and investors may look to take losses and avoid further exposure until market conditions stabilize."
