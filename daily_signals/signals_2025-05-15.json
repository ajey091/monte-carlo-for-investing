    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears to be bearish, as all listed ETFs are signaling to sell. This is indicated by the bearish moving average crossovers across multiple ETFs, a lack of the momentum indicated by RSI values around neutral, and low volatility conditions that suggest a consolidation phase rather than accelerating trends. \n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $540.11\n  - *Key Levels:* Watch for support at the MA long level of $512.28. \n  - Recommendation: Close positions to mitigate potential losses.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $88.84\n  - *Key Levels:* Monitor the MA long level at $81.73 for potential bounce points.\n  - Recommendation: Exit positions as the bearish crossover indicates likely downward movement.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $79.64\n  - *Key Levels:* Pay attention to the MA long level of $72.01 for support.\n  - Recommendation: Consider liquidating positions to avoid further losses.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $518.68\n  - *Key Levels:* Support found at $476.12 (MA long).\n  - Recommendation: Exit positions to avoid exposure to downside.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $104.93\n  - *Key Levels:* Look for support at $90.95 (MA long).\n  - Recommendation: Liquidate holdings to minimize risk of decline.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $70.36\n  - *Key Levels:* Watch for price action near $58.78 (MA long).\n  - Recommendation: Close positions to preserve capital.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares):** **SELL**\n  - *Close Price:* $18.84\n  - *Key Levels:* Monitor support at $15.86 (MA long).\n  - Recommendation: Exit holdings to mitigate risk of further decline.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\nInvesting in leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL poses a heightened risk due to their ability to amplify market movements. Their current sell signals, combined with low volatility, can lead to significant losses if the market declines sharply. Execute stop-loss orders if retained for specific trades to manage downside risk effectively.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels:**\n  - VOO: $512.28\n  - SSO: $81.73\n  - UPRO: $72.01\n  - QQQ: $476.12\n  - QLD: $90.95\n  - TQQQ: $58.78\n  - SOXL: $15.86\n\nThese levels should be closely monitored for potential reversal or continued downward momentum. Markets often test these levels, and a break below them could indicate further bearish sentiment."
