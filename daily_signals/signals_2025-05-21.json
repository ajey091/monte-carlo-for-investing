    "summary": "### Current Market Analysis\n\n1. **Overall Market Sentiment:**\n   The current market sentiment is predominantly **bearish**, as all analyzed ETFs show \"SELL\" signals. Key indicators, including moving average crossovers (all bearish) and high RSI levels (indicating potential overbought conditions), suggest that the market is due for a pullback. Low volatility across these securities indicatesless risk of abrupt movement while maintaining a cautious stance.\n\n2. **Specific Recommendations for Each ETF:**\n   - **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** \n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Bearish signals combined with an RSI nearing 74 suggest a market top.\n   - **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Similar to VOO with bearish MA signals and RSI close to overbought conditions.\n   - **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Short-term bearish crossover indicates weakening momentum.\n   - **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Same bearish trend with a high RSI indicating imminent corrections.\n   - **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Bearish technicals suggest the fund may decline near-term.\n   - **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: Overbought conditions may lead to a significant pullback.\n   - **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares):**\n     - Recommendation: **Sell**\n     - Rationale: High RSI and bearish crossovers indicate significant upside risk.\n\n3. **Risk Warnings:**\n   - All recommended sells are based on current overbought conditions, which may lead to significant short-term corrections. \n   - Leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) amplify the risk; losses can mount quickly in volatile conditions.\n   - Market sentiment can change swiftly; traders should be prepared for rapid shifts.\n\n4. **Key Levels to Watch:**\n   - **VOO:** Watch for the support level around $510 (MA long) and resistance around $550 for potential reversal.\n   - **SSO:** Support near $80.45 (MA short) and resistance at $91.\n   - **UPRO:** Look for support around $69.78 and resistance at higher levels.\n   - **QQQ:** Support at approximately $475 and resistance around $525.\n   - **QLD:** Watch $89.63 for support and $107 for resistance.\n   - **TQQQ:** Key support near $56.85, resistance around $71.\n   - **SOXL:** Support should be closely watched at $14.47; resistance at $18.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the current bearish signals and overbought conditions, it is advisable to exit long positions on these ETFs or wait for more favorable market conditions before re-entering. Monitor the key levels discussed to manage risk effectively."
