    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish across the board as indicated by all ETFs signaling a \"SELL.\" This suggests that investors might be cautious about making new investments or holding onto existing positions. Key technical indicators support this sentiment, with all ETFs exhibiting bearish moving average (MA) crossovers and relatively high RSI values, yet not extreme (all under 70), indicating a potential for reversal. The overall volatility remains low to moderately low, suggesting that while the market isn't particularly volatile, the prevailing trend could lead to price declines.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Bearish trend confirmed by MA cross and high RSI nearing overbought conditions.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Similar bearish sentiment with MA cross indicating downward momentum, despite a stable RSI.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Confirmation of bearish index crossover. Low average prices signal potential profit-taking.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Strong bearish indicators alongside a high RSI suggest near-term overextension.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Continued bearish MA indicators align with QQQ sell signal, indicating the potential for downward movement.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: All bearish signals in place, combined with relative strength indicators not showing extreme oversold conditions.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation**: SELL\n   - **Reason**: Despite being a leveraged ETF, it follows the bearish trend and signals profit-taking or position closure.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Market Volatility**: Although current volatility remains low, global market conditions can change rapidly. Be cautious of sudden market shifts.\n- **Leveraged ETFs**: The inherent risks with leveraged ETFs such as SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL are significant. These products amplify returns but also amplify losses. Close monitoring is necessary as they can deviate from the anticipated performance of underlying indices during volatile periods.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Resistance Levels**: Watch for key resistance around the closing prices near recent peaks (e.g., VOO at $535.77, QQQ at $513.04). If these levels are breached, it may indicate a trend reversal.\n- **Support Levels**: Observe short-term support levels indicated by moving averages for potential bounce opportunities. For instance:\n  - VOO: $510\n  - QQQ: $475\n  - SSO: $80\n  - UPRO: $70\n  - TQQQ: Approximately $57 (MA support)\n  - SOXL: Approximately $14.41 (MA support)\n\nIn conclusion, the current bearish indicators across all analyzed ETFs suggest a cautious approach, favoring selling positions while closely monitoring key levels to better assess potential market rebounds."
