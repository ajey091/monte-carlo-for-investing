    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish, as indicated by the sell signals across major ETFs, including both standard and leveraged ETFs. The moving average (MA) cross indicators are showing bearish trends, coupled with relatively high RSI values indicating overbought conditions. Low volatility across the board suggests a lack of significant price swings, which may further impact momentum.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $540.24\n   - **Reason**: Bearish MA cross and RSI indicating overbought conditions.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $88.63\n   - **Reason**: Similar bearish indicators as VOO. Given its leveraged nature, losses could be magnified.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $79.17\n   - **Reason**: Continued bearish signals; avoid new positions, as this is a leveraged ETF which could lead to amplified risks.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Hold**\n   - **Current Price**: $518.91\n   - **Reason**: Despite hitting resistance, it maintains a bullish MA cross, signifying a stronger position relative to others. However, be cautious if the trend shifts.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $104.73\n   - **Reason**: Bearish signals dominate; this leveraged ETF carries a higher risk in a negative market environment.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $70.03\n   - **Reason**: High risk with a bearish outlook; avoid due to potential volatility amplifying losses.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation**: **Sell**\n   - **Current Price**: $17.04\n   - **Reason**: Signals indicate a bearish trend; the leveraged nature could exacerbate losses in a downturn.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Leveraged ETFs** (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) are particularly risky, especially in a bearish trend. They can amplify losses, so it's advisable to act cautiously when considering trades in these funds.\n- The market is showing signs of potential volatility change, especially if the broader market indicators shift.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch $535.00 for support; a breach here may confirm further declines.\n- **QQQ**: Watch the resistance at ~$525.00; movement above could indicate strengthening.\n- **UPRO & SSO**: Pay attention to the moving averages around $80; these levels could signal the strength of the bearish trend.\n- **QLD & TQQQ**: Key levels are near $100 for QLD and $70 for TQQQ; breaches below these levels could signal intensified negative movement.\n\nIn summary, the prevailing market is somewhat bearish, largely dictated by overbought conditions across several ETFs. Traders should heed sell signals while exercising caution with leveraged instruments."
