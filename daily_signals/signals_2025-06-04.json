    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish across all the analyzed ETFs. All signals indicate \"SELL\" due to key technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions (high RSI) coupled with bearish moving average crossovers. The market is characterized by low volatility, which often precedes corrections or pullbacks, suggesting that retracements may be imminent.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI is at 77.46 (overbought), with bearish crossovers in moving averages.\n  \n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI of 76.25 suggests overbought conditions, with a bearish MA crossover.\n  \n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI at 75.57, indicating overbought status along with bearish momentum indicators.\n  \n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI of 81.27 reinforces overbought signals, despite a bullish MA crossover, suggesting a potential shift.\n  \n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** High RSI value (80.23) indicates overbought territory, coupled with bearish MA signals.\n  \n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI of 79.48 identifies overbought conditions, with a bearish MA crossover.\n  \n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semicond. Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Recommendation:** Sell\n  - **Rationale:** RSI at 72.49 indicates overbought status, while MA indicators support a bearish outlook.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **Market Pullback Risk:** With all indicators flashing sell signals and low volatility, a market correction could happen anytime. Investors should prepare for heightened volatility if positions are held.\n- **Leveraged ETFs:** Such as SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL can amplify losses during downturns more than traditional ETFs. Be cautious with these products, as they are designed for short-term trading, not for long-term holding.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**: Monitor support levels for each ETF based on historical price action to evaluate potential entry or exit points.\n- **Resistance Levels**: Each of these ETFs has significant resistance that if breached could invalidate current bearish momentum; keep an eye on these levels for potential short-term gains before continuing to trade off the bearish signals.\n\nIn summary, the current market indicators suggest a strong sell-off across the board for these ETFs, reflecting overbought conditions. As such, investors should take immediate action to minimize possible losses and watch key levels closely for further guidance."
