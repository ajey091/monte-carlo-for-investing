    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears bearish as all signals point towards selling opportunities for most ETFs and leveraged ETFs. The majority of the ETFs exhibit signs of overbought conditions, indicated by elevated RSI levels, while also showing bearish moving average crossovers. \n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Action:** SELL\n   - **Rationale:** The bearish moving average crossover and high RSI (71.79) indicate a potential price correction. \n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500 ETF)**\n   - **Action:** SELL\n   - **Rationale:** Similar to VOO, it has a bearish MA crossover and RSI at 70.73, suggesting it's overbought and prone to a pullback.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Action:** SELL\n   - **Rationale:** RSI at 70.33 and a bearish MA crossover indicate it's time to exit as risks for declines increase.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Action:** HOLD\n   - **Rationale:** It has a bullish MA crossover but an elevated RSI (75.30). Holding positions may be wise but prepare for potential downward corrections.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Action:** HOLD\n   - **Rationale:** Similarly, QLD shows a bullish outlook, but with an RSI of 74.39, a cautious approach is recommended.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Action:** SELL\n   - **Rationale:** The bearish crossover combined with a high RSI (73.93) suggests it could be a good time to exit this leveraged position.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Action:** SELL\n   - **Rationale:** With a high RSI of 74.12 and a bearish MA crossover, this leveraged ETF is also a candidate for selling.\n\n### Risk Warnings\nInvestors should be cautious about entering or holding leveraged ETFs during a bearish phase, as these instruments magnify losses and can experience heightened volatility. Monitor for any rapid price movements and be prepared to take defensive actions.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**: Keep an eye on the previous low levels and moving averages as potential support for each ETF, where reversals might happen if the market sentiment improves.\n- **Resistance Levels**: Watch the recent highs for signals of overextension or a potential bounce back if there's a price retracement.\n  \n### Conclusion\nGiven the current market indicators, reducing exposure to most ETFs is prudent, while maintaining positions in QQQ and QLD can be considered if a cautious approach to monitoring market movements is taken. Keeping abreast of key levels could signal future entry points as conditions evolve."
