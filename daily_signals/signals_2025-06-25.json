Consider adding more if bullish confirmations strengthen.\n   - **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - Likely to benefit from continued market growth. Monitor for bullish reversals.\n   - **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - A solid choice for tech exposure.

Keep an eye on growth factors and global demand.\n\n3. **Risk Warnings**:\n   - While the overall indicators are positive, consider the following risks:\n     - **Market Pullbacks**: Given that all signals are currently \"HOLD,\" be wary of potential corrections that could affect leveraged ETFs (like SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL) more dramatically due to their leveraged nature.\n     - **Rising Volatility**: Although currently low, volatility can spike unexpectedly, especially in leveraged products.\n     - **Economic Indicators**: Ongoing inflation or interest rate shifts may impact growth outlooks, so watch economic news closely.\n\n4. **Key Levels to Watch**:\n   - **VOO**: Watch for support at 530 (short MA) and resistance near 560 (current price level).\n   - **SSO**: Maintain awareness of support at 85.8 (short MA) and resistance at 95.\n   - **UPRO**: Strong support at 75 (short MA); watch for resistance at 90.\n   - **QQQ**: Support at 503 (short MA) and check for resistance at approximately 540.\n   - **QLD**: Key support at 99 (short MA) and resistance at 115.\n   - **TQQQ**: Cash into support around 65 (short MA) and resistance near 80.\n   - **SOXL**: Watch for support at 16.5 (short MA) with resistance at 25.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe market is currently in a hold phase across various ETFs, including leveraged products. As conditions remain generally bullish with low volatility, positions can be maintained while closely observing economic signals and market dynamics that could impact price movements. Investors in leveraged ETFs should pay particular attention to risk management strategies."
