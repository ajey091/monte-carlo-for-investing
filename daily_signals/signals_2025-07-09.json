    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment across the analyzed ETFs is predominantly bullish, with all signals indicating a \"HOLD\" position. The moving average crossovers are bullish for all ETFs, and despite overbought conditions indicated by the RSI values (most above 70), the volatility remains low across the board. This suggests that while the market is in a strong trend, it may be due for a correction or pause at these elevated levels.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: Strong bullish indicators. Watch for potential profit-taking given the elevated RSI.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: Strong performance with a bullish MA crossover. Pay attention to the potential for a pullback as momentum may weaken.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: Leveraged ETF showing strong bullish momentum, but also higher volatility than traditional ETFs. Maintain current positions while monitoring for excessive RSI values.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: Technology sector continues to lead with strong bullish signals. Consider offloading if RSI moves significantly higher.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: The QLD benefits from bullish trends in the tech sector, but lagging slightly behind the underlying asset. Watch for any weakening in tech stocks.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: High volatility and returns indicative of upward trends in tech, but potential for sharp corrections with RSI nearing overbought territory.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n  - **Rationale**: Strong bullish indicators but with heightened volatility due to sector-specific movements. Monitor closely for reversals due to the high RSI.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings if Applicable\n- All ETFs are currently showing signs of overbought conditions (RSI > 70), which raises the risk of a short-term pullback or correction.\n- Leveraged ETFs, particularly SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL, carry higher risk profiles due to compounding effects and increased volatility. They should be monitored closely, especially during market fluctuations.\n- Investors should watch for sudden shifts in market sentiment or broader economic indicators that may impact these sectors.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**:\n  - VOO: ~543.69 (short MA)\n  - SSO: ~90.11 (short MA)\n  - UPRO: ~81.31 (short MA)\n  - QQQ: ~521.72 (short MA)\n  - QLD: ~106.02 (short MA)\n  - TQQQ: ~71.35 (short MA)\n  - SOXL: ~19.25 (short MA)\n\n- **Resistance Levels**:\n  - VOO: Current highs around 570.23\n  - SSO: Current highs around 98.34\n  - UPRO: Current highs around 92.25\n  - QQQ: Current highs around 552.34\n  - QLD: Current highs around 117.79\n  - TQQQ: Current highs around 83.03\n  - SOXL: Current highs around 26.37\n\nMonitoring the key support and resistance levels will help investors strategize optimal entry and exit points while considering market sentiment and potential profit-taking triggers."
