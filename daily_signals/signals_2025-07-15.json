    "summary": "### Summary of Current Market Situation\n\n1. **Overall Market Sentiment:**\n   - The current market sentiment across all analyzed ETFs is cautiously optimistic with a strong bullish trend indicated by moving average crossovers. The RSI levels hover around neutral to slightly high, suggesting potential overbought conditions but not immediately signaling a sell-off. Most volatility levels are low, indicating a stable environment for investments in these ETFs.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** With a close price above both short-term and long-term moving averages and a bullish MA crossover, VOO shows strong bullish momentum. Monitor RSI as it approaches overbought territory.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** Similar indicators as VOO with a bullish signal and good support from moving averages. Maintain position unless RSI escalates toward overbought levels.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** Strong bullish indicators with the lowest RSI among S&P-focused leveraged ETFs, suggesting it could potentially recover while volatility remains manageable.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** Positive MA signals and a strong price above moving averages indicate health in tech-heavy holdings. Watch for RSI trends as it progresses.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** Follows similar bullish momentum with good support. The risk of correction is indicated but remains manageable.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** Strong bullish indicators with increasing volatility; approach with caution due to leveraged risk. Ensure monitoring of RSI for potential pulls.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Recommendation:** HOLD\n  - **Rationale:** The strongest bullish momentum observed, but price shows high RSI and higher volatility. Caution is advised due to increased exposure in specific sectors.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n\n- **Overbought Conditions:** Several ETFs, especially SOXL, have RSIs above 70, indicating potential overbought conditions. These suggest increased risk of price pullbacks in the short term.\n  \n- **Volatility Considerations:** Leveraged ETFs like UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL exhibit a heightened volatility profile, which can amplify both gains and losses. Assess risk tolerance before maintaining or increasing positions.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n\n- **VOO:** $574.00 (near resistance) / Support around $548.00.\n- **SSO:** $99.00 (resistance) / Support near $91.00.\n- **UPRO:** $94.00 (resistance) / Support around $83.00.\n- **QQQ:** $556.00 (approaching resistance) / Key support near $528.00.\n- **QLD:** $119.00 (resistance) / Support around $108.00.\n- **TQQQ:** $84.00 (resistance) / Support near $74.00.\n- **SOXL:** $26.50 (current level) / Support evidenced around $20.00.\n\nOverall, maintain a cautious yet optimistic outlook, leveraging this analysis to navigate positions intelligently while being wary of elevated RSI levels and market volatility."
