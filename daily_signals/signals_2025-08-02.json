    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears to be moderately bullish as indicated by the \"HOLD\" signals across major ETFs. The moving average crosses are bullish for each ETF, suggesting that short-term trends are supporting the long-term trends. The overall RSI values are nearing overbought conditions, particularly for VOO and QQQ, signaling potential caution, though none of them suggest immediate bearishness. Low volatility levels across the board also suggest stable market conditions.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Current price respects support from moving averages.\n  \n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Price close to moving average support provides a buffer against pullbacks.\n  \n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. The price shows strong support above short and long MA; consider monitoring closely for momentum.\n  \n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Strong performance backed by bullish moving averages; watch for signs of RSI divergence.\n  \n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Remains supported with bullish indicators; good for those optimistic about growth stocks.\n  \n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Ideal for aggressive investors; revisit for potential buy on dips.\n  \n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold. Given higher volatility, exercise caution but maintain position if bullish on semiconductors.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings if Applicable\n- The market is nearing overbought levels as indicated by RSI readings, particularly for VOO and QQQ. This could lead to potential pullbacks or corrections, so investors should be prepared for volatility.\n- Leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL are subject to greater risk due to their magnified returns and potential losses. Investors should be particularly cautious and consider their risk tolerance.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch for support at $563 and resistance near $571.\n- **SSO**: Support at $96 and resistance at approximately $98.50.\n- **UPRO**: Key support at $89; resistance levels around $92.70.\n- **QQQ**: Key support at $545; watch resistance around $560.\n- **QLD**: Maintain awareness of $115 as a resistance level, with support at $113.\n- **TQQQ**: Important to monitor support at $80; potential resistance at $85.\n- **SOXL**: Keep an eye on $23.50 as support, with resistance around $25.\n\nOverall, the market currently presents a cautiously optimistic environment for holding these ETFs, with strong bullish signals but the warning to be vigilant about potential overbought conditions."
