    "summary": "### Market Sentiment Overview\nThe current market sentiment across the observed ETFs is **Bullish**, with most exhibiting indicators suggesting potential continued upward trends. All reviewed ETFs have bullish moving average crosses, implying that short-term moving averages are above long-term moving averages. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for most is in the neutral range, indicating that while the market is favorable, it is not excessively overbought or oversold. Volatility is low for all ETFs, suggesting a stable trading environment.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support around $576.86 (short MA) and resistance at current levels of $590.70.\n   \n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Watch for support at $100.40 (short MA). Current price at $104.55 suggests potential for moderate growth.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support at $95.07 (short MA) with a current price of $100.67 providing a buffer for potential pullbacks.\n   \n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Key support at $559.95 (short MA) and resistance around current levels of $570.32.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Short-term support near $120.76 with current price action suggesting continuity in upward movement.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Look for support at $86.08 (short MA); current price is $89.59, which indicates stability.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Short MA at $25.92 for immediate support; current price at $27.30 is significant to maintain upward trajectory.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Market Volatility**: Despite low volatility currently, any geopolitical tensions or economic data releases could quickly increase volatility, particularly for leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL, which are sensitive to market shifts due to their leveraged nature.\n- **Leveraged ETF Risks**: Leveraged ETFs can amplify both gains and losses. Holding them in a stable market is advisable, but caution is warranted during market corrections or downturns.\n- **RSI Consideration**: The RSI values, while neutral, are approaching the upper range for some ETFs, indicating caution if prices start to significantly exceed current levels.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Support at $576.86, resistance at $590.70\n- **SSO**: Support at $100.40, resistance around $104.55\n- **UPRO**: Support at $95.07, price action near $100.67\n- **QQQ**: Support at $559.95, resistance at $570.32\n- **QLD**: Support at $120.76, current price $124.39\n- **TQQQ**: Support at $86.08, current price $89.59\n- **SOXL**: Support at $25.92, current price $27.30\n\nOverall, adopting a \"hold\" strategy seems prudent while monitoring the ongoing market dynamics and respective key levels."
