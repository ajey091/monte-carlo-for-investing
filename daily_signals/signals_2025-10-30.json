    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is moderately bullish, as indicated by the \"HOLD\" signals across all reviewed ETFs. Each of the ETFs shows a bullish moving average crossover, with RSI values mostly in the neutral and slightly overbought region. With low volatility across the board, the market appears stable. However, investors should remain cautious as RSI is approaching the upper range, suggesting the potential for a pullback.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n#### VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~607.70 (short MA) and resistance at 631.95 (current price).\n\n#### SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~110.47 (short MA) and resistance at 118.65 (current price).\n\n#### UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~109.07 (short MA) and resistance at 120.91 (current price).\n\n#### QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~595.67 (short MA) and resistance at 635.77 (current price).\n\n#### QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~135.16 (short MA) and resistance at 152.77 (current price).\n\n#### TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~101.09 (short MA) and resistance at 120.61 (current price).\n\n#### SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)\n- **Action:** Hold, no immediate changes.\n- **Key Levels to Watch:** Support at ~34.87 (short MA) and resistance at 49.38 (current price).\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **Market Overextension:** The current RSI readings are approaching overbought levels, which can indicate an increased risk of a market pullback. \n- **Leveraged ETFs Risks:** Leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL can magnify both gains and losses; extreme volatility in the underlying assets can lead to significant losses beyond initial investments.\n- **Dependence on Economic Factors:** Changes in macroeconomic factors or earnings can lead to unexpected volatility.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels:** Keep an eye on short MA values, which provide immediate support during pullbacks for each ETF.\n- **Resistance Levels:** The current close prices act as immediate resistance levels; a break above could trigger further bullish momentum across the board.\n- **RSI Levels:** Monitor RSI nearing 70, as it may indicate overbought territory which could signal caution in a volatile market.\n\nIn conclusion, a cautious \"HOLD\" strategy is recommended across all ETFs, while being mindful of market conditions and potential volatility in the future."
