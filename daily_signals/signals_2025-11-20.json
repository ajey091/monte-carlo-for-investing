    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is neutral. The signals across all ETFs indicate to \"HOLD,\" reflecting a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Indicators such as the moving average crossovers are bullish, yet the RSI values remain below 50, suggesting weak buying momentum. Low volatility supports this view, indicating that there is no immediate surge in market activity.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Stay on the sidelines until either momentum picks up or the price crosses above the moving averages.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at approximately $615 (short MA), support near $609.\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Similar to VOO, wait for clearer signals.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around $113 (short MA), support at $109.\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Maintain current position; watch for potential breakout above the moving averages.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $112 (short MA), support near $107.\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Evaluate performance closely; look for price action to confirm breakout.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $608 (short MA), support near $599.\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Maintain current approach until additional upward momentum is confirmed.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $140 (short MA), support around $135.\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Similar to QLD; focus on price trends and MA thresholds.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $106 (short MA), support near $100.\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X ETF)**  \n   - **Recommendation:** HOLD  \n   - **Key Insights:** Continue holding while monitoring for momentum shifts; significant volatility may present trading opportunities.  \n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $40 (short MA), support around $36.\n\n### Risk Warnings\n1. **Market Stagnation:** No clear trend indicates potential risk for sudden market movements. Be prepared for unexpected volatility.\n2. **Leveraged ETFs Risk:** Leveraged ETFs like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL can amplify losses as much as they can amplify gains, especially in unstable market conditions. Manage position sizes carefully.\n3. **Investing Duration:** Short-term traders may need to exercise caution as holding periods could lead to erosion in returns due to volatility decay in leveraged ETFs.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- Be attentive to the moving average levels which are critical support and resistance points. Crossovers strong enough to confirm a trend could lead to buying or selling opportunities.\n- Closely monitor RSI values, as moving above or below 50 could indicate a shift in momentum.\n- Maintaining awareness of external factors (economic indicators, earnings reports, geopolitical events) is crucial, as they may influence market movements unexpectedly. \n\nIn summary, the modeling suggests holding positions while watching for clearer signals and key technical levels."
