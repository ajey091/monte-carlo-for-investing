    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears to be **neutral to cautiously bullish** across the analyzed ETFs. Majority of the ETFs are signaling a \"HOLD\" status, indicating indecision in the market. The moving averages show bullish crossovers, suggesting potential upward momentum, but neutral RSI values indicate that the momentum is currently lacking strength. Volatility remains low, reflecting a stable market environment.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Recommendation**: Maintain current position. Watch for a breakout above the short-term moving average of $615.66 for potential re-entry.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Signal**: BUY\n  - **Recommendation**: Consider entering or adding to positions given the oversold RSI and bullish moving average crossover. Target resistances above the current price.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Recommendation**: Continue holding as it recovers from recent lows. Monitor the price movement closely, especially around the moving averages for potential entry or reallocation.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold current positions and prepare for possible adjustments if the ETF can move above the short-term MA of $608.14.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Signal**: BUY\n  - **Recommendation**: Entering a position may be advantageous considering the current oversold conditions. Watch for price movements above the short-term MA for confirmation.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Signal**: BUY\n  - **Recommendation**: Due to the oversold RSI and bullish momentum indicators, this may be a favorable entry point. Pay attention to resistances above $46.45.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Recommendation**: Hold current positions, given neutral market indicators. Watch for a move above the short-term moving average for new entry signals.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\nInvestors should be cautious with leveraged ETFs (like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) as they can experience higher volatility and risk of significant losses, especially in a choppy or reversing market environment. The oversold conditions may present opportunities, but they also carry the risk of continued downward movement before a potential turnaround.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch for resistance around $615.66 (short MA) and support near the current price level of $600.\n- **SSO**: Key resistance priced around $111.74 (short MA) and support near the current price of $53.21.\n- **UPRO**: Resistance at $112.34 (short MA) and support around $100.\n- **QQQ**: Resistance at $608.14 (short MA) and support at current levels around $585.67.\n- **QLD**: Resistance priced around $138.74 (short MA) and a primary support zone close to the current price of $64.41.\n- **TQQQ**: Resistance near $105.27 (short MA) and support just under the current price level of $46.45.\n- **SOXL**: Resistance at $39.61 (short MA) and support near the current price of $30.81.\n\nIn summary, maintain a balanced approach with close monitoring of signals and key levels as you navigate these investments in the current market context."
