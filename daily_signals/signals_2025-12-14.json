    "summary": "**Current Market Analysis (As of December 12, 2025)**\n\n1. **Overall Market Sentiment:**\n   The current sentiment across the market is neutral, with all analyzed ETFs issuing a \"HOLD\" signal. The key technical indicators indicate a predominantly bullish sentiment (indicating potential upward movement), but the RSI values for most ETFs hover around neutral (near the 50 level), implying indecision in market momentum. Additionally, the overall volatility is deemed low, suggesting that while the market may not be experiencing dramatic shifts, caution is warranted due to the potential for unexpected consequences.\n\n2. **Specific Recommendations:**\n   - **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** *HOLD* - Maintain your position as the short-term moving average (MA) is above the long-term MA. Consider monitoring for upward momentum beyond an RSI of 50.\n   \n   - **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P 500):** *HOLD* - Similar to VOO, keep your current holdings. Look for potential entry points should the price gain traction above MA and a strengthening RSI.\n   \n   - **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500):** *HOLD* - Hold positions. The market's short-term bullish indicators suggest it may be poised for a breakout if momentum builds in the coming days.\n   \n   - **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust):** *HOLD* - Same recommendation of holding. Watch for whether QQQ can regain momentum above the short-term MA to signal a stronger bullish trend.\n   \n   - **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ):** *HOLD* - Continue holding. While current RSI values indicate weakness, bullish conditions could strengthen if the market responds positively.\n   \n   - **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ):** *HOLD* - As with other ETFs, maintain your holdings. Consider capitalizing if the market shows signs of recovery beyond current levels.\n   \n   - **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares):** *HOLD* - While currently volatile, maintain a watchful hold in case of further upside, especially since it is a leveraged fund.\n\n3. **Risk Warnings:**\n   - Leverage: All leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) have higher volatility and risk. Price swings can be magnified: while they can offer greater returns, losses can also be significant. Therefore, be prepared for short-term price fluctuations.\n   - Neutral RSI Levels: The presence of neutral RSI levels (close to 50) across these ETFs suggests potential sideways trading without a decisive trend; hence, it is wise to utilize stop-loss orders to protect your investments in case of unfavorable shifts.\n\n4. **Key Levels to Watch:**\n   - **Support Levels:**\n     - VOO: ~620\n     - SSO: ~56.85\n     - UPRO: ~113.38\n     - QQQ: ~611.65\n     - QLD: ~70.60\n     - TQQQ: ~53.60\n     - SOXL: ~41.04\n     \n   - **Resistance Levels:**\n     - VOO: ~630\n     - SSO: ~58.00\n     - UPRO: ~118.00\n     - QQQ: ~620.00\n     - QLD: ~72.00\n     - TQQQ: ~54.50\n     - SOXL: ~42.00\n\nIn summary, while current market indicators suggest holding onto existing positions, keep a close eye on the key support and resistance levels, and monitor RSI movements closely as they could indicate a change in momentum. Consider the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs and remain vigilant against potential market volatility."
