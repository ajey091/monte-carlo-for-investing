    "summary": "### Market Analysis Summary (as of February 4, 2026)\n\n1. **Overall Market Sentiment**: \n   The current market sentiment is relatively neutral to cautiously optimistic. All ETFs listed are currently signaling to \"HOLD\". The presence of bullish MA crossovers indicates potential upward momentum; however, the RSI values hover around neutral levels, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in any direction. Additionally, low volatility across the board implies a stable market environment but may also limit short-term gains.\n\n2. **Specific ETF Recommendations**:\n   - **VOO**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Watch for support at the long MA of 627.64 and resistance at the short MA of 631.04.\n   - **SSO**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Watch for support at the long MA of 58.10 and resistance at the short MA of 58.65.\n   - **UPRO**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Watch for support at the long MA of 116.43 and resistance at the short MA of 117.96.\n   - **QQQ**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Bear in mind the current weakness with an RSI below 45; support at 600 should be considered, and resistance at the short MA of 619.98.\n   - **QLD**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Watch for support at the long MA of 71.12 and resistance at the short MA of 71.73. The RSI indicates potential bearishness, requiring careful monitoring of market trends.\n   - **TQQQ**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Support at the long MA of 53.60 and resistance at the short MA of 54.22. Be cautious of the lower RSI reading.\n   - **SOXL**: \n     - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n     - **Key Levels**: Notably stronger with an RSI above 56. Watch for support at the long MA of 48.28 and resistance at the short MA of 50.81.\n\n3. **Risk Warnings**:\n   - Despite the HOLD signals, all ETFs exhibit low momentum (indicated by mid-range RSI values), and the market's upcoming volatility could result in swift changes. \n   - The leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ) are particularly susceptible to significant price swings. Investors should remain cautious and prepared for potential quick losses, especially if leverage magnifies any downward movements.\n\n4. **Key Levels to Watch**:\n   It is critical to monitor both the short and long moving averages and key individual price points for support and resistance. \n   - **General Market Levels**: Look towards significant price zones and previous lows/highs for possible reversals.\n   - **ETFs**: Pay specific attention to the MA cross indications; if the MA short moves above the MA long, it would indicate strengthened bullish momentum, and vice versa for bearish signals.\n\nIn conclusion, the current market signals suggest a phase of consolidation with potential for upward movement, though caution is warranted due to low momentum and underlying risks associated with leverage. Positioning in leveraged ETFs should be done with careful consideration of volatility and market conditions."
