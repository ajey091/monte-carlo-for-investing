    "summary": "### Current Market Overview\n\nAs of February 13, 2026, the market sentiment across the analyzed ETFs is largely neutral, as all signals indicate a \"HOLD\" status. Despite a bullish moving average cross, the relative strength index (RSI) values mirror a slightly bearish fading momentum, particularly for the leveraged ETFs. Market volatility appears to be low across all ETFs, with most of them exhibiting relatively low volatility measures (value below 0.03). \n\nHowever, the overall support shows signs of weakness since all ETFs are currently trading below their short-term moving averages. This presents a cautious outlook but suggests that there may be an opportunity for positive movement if market conditions improve.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n#### 1. **VOO** (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support at close_price ($626.89); watch for resistance near the short MA ($631.92).\n  \n#### 2. **SSO** (ProShares Ultra S&P 500)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support at close_price ($57.37); resistance could emerge around the shorter MA ($58.70).\n   \n#### 3. **UPRO** (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD \n   - **Key Levels**: Watch support at close_price ($113.51) and resistance around the short MA ($117.99).\n   \n#### 4. **QQQ** (Invesco QQQ Trust)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support at $601.92; resistance at $618.04 (short MA).\n   \n#### 5. **QLD** (ProShares Ultra QQQ)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD\n   - **Key Levels**: Support at $66.92; resistance around $71.14 (short MA).\n   \n#### 6. **TQQQ** (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD \n   - **Key Levels**: Support at $48.47 and resistance around $53.47.\n   \n#### 7. **SOXL** (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares)\n   - **Recommendation**: HOLD \n   - **Key Levels**: Strong support at $64.59; resistance around $53.67 (short MA).\n  \n### Risk Warnings\n1. **Market Volatility**: Low volatility currently observed could signal an imminent increase in activity, either up or down, which may prompt sudden price changes. \n2. **Performance of Leveraged ETFs**: The leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, SOXL) carry higher risk/reward profiles. Given their structure, they can amplify losses as well as gains due to daily resetting; monitor closely for shifts in market conditions.\n3. **Technical Indicators**: The neutral RSI readings indicate that the assets may not be trending strongly in either direction; investors should prepare for potential consolidation before a clear direction is established.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Support Levels**: These are critical to watch as they could indicate where buying interest might emerge:\n   - VOO ($626.89), SSO ($57.37), UPRO ($113.51), QQQ ($601.92), QLD ($66.92), TQQQ ($48.47), SOXL ($64.59)\n- **Resistance Levels**: These levels should be monitored for potential breakout points:\n   - VOO ($631.92), SSO ($58.70), UPRO ($117.99), QQQ ($618.04), QLD ($71.14), TQQQ ($53.47), SOXL ($53.67)\n\nIn conclusion, the current market situation is stable, though cautious. Positions in these ETFs should continue to be held while monitoring key technical levels for further movement in the market."
