    "summary": "### Current Market Analysis (for February 20, 2026)\n\n#### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe overall market sentiment is mixed, characterized by stability in some ETFs while others show bearish signals. The majority of ETFs in our analysis recommend a \"HOLD\" strategy, indicating that there is no immediate strong momentum either downward or upward across most assets. However, caution is necessary for those showing \"SELL\" signals, particularly in growth-driven equities as reflected in QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ.\n\n#### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD \n  - **Recommendation**: Hold as it's demonstrating stability with a bullish MA cross. No immediate action is suggested, but monitor closely for signs of trend reversal.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD \n  - **Recommendation**: Similar to VOO, continue holding SSO as it mirrors the general market stability. Watch for confirmation of upward momentum.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD \n  - **Recommendation**: Maintain positions. Low RSI indicates neutrality; however, be ready to adjust if market conditions change.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL \n  - **Recommendation**: Consider selling as bearish signs emerge (MA cross and declining momentum). This ETF is particularly susceptible to tech sector volatility.\n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL \n  - **Recommendation**: Sell positions in QLD, following the bearish MA cross. This leveraged ETF is sensitive to declines in tech, and downside risk is heightened.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL \n  - **Recommendation**: Strongly consider selling or reducing exposure to TQQQ due to pronounced bearish indicators. The high volatility further compounds risk.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD \n  - **Recommendation**: Continue holding SOXL as it shows significant upward momentum with a bullish MA cross. However, use caution due to the inherent risk associated with leveraged ETFs.\n\n#### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ**: The bearish signals indicate a potential downturn, especially within the tech sector. Selling these ETFs could mitigate exposure to significant losses.\n- **Leveraged ETFs**: Be mindful of the increased volatility and risk associated with ETFs such as SSO, UPRO, QLD, and TQQQ. If market conditions worsen, losses can accelerate quickly.\n\n#### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO Support/Resistance**: \n  - Support at 631.25 (MA Long)\n  - Resistance near 636 (previous high)\n\n- **QQQ Support/Resistance**: \n  - Support around 605 (recent low)\n  - Resistance at 616.34 (MA Short)\n\n- **UPRO Support/Resistance**:\n  - Support close to 117 (recent levels)\n  - Resistance near 120 (previous high)\n\nStrategically using these levels could provide insight for buying or selling decisions going forward. Monitoring the RSI and MA trends will keep investors alert to significant trends or reversals."
