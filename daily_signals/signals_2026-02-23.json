    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is mixed to slightly bullish overall, indicated by the \"HOLD\" signals for most ETFs, especially those associated with broader markets such as VOO, SSO, UPRO, and SOXL. However, there is bearish sentiment in the technology sector, as indicated by the \"SELL\" signals for QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ, suggesting some caution in tech-based investments. The low volatility readings across all ETFs imply a relatively stable market environment.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Consider holding for the short term as it shows bullish crossover momentum. Monitor for any signs of trend changes.\n\n- **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Maintain current position. With bullish MA crossover, it may continue to yield moderate gains.\n\n- **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Similar to SSO, maintaining positions in UPRO is advisable. Watch closely as the market conditions evolve.\n\n- **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** Consider reducing exposure. The bearish crossover could indicate further declines, especially in tech stocks. \n\n- **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** This leveraged ETF shows a sell signal as well. It's advisable to offload positions to mitigate potential losses.\n\n- **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** Given the bearish outlook, selling TQQQ is recommended to avoid further downside risk.\n\n- **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Hold on to investments, as it currently shows bullish momentum with a high RSI reflecting strong relative strength.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings if Applicable\n- Be cautious with leveraged ETFs (SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ). They can amplify gains but also magnify losses, especially in a downturn. Given the mixed signals, investors should ensure they have exit strategies in place to protect against market reversals.\n- The tech sector's bearish signs in QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ could indicate broader market corrections. Keep a close watch on economic indicators that may influence tech performance.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO:** Watch for support around $631; resistance level is close to $635.\n- **SSO:** Support at $58.50 and resistance near $59.50.\n- **UPRO:** Support is around $117; resistance at $120.\n- **QQQ:** Watch for critical support at $605, with resistance near $612.\n- **QLD:** Weak support at $67; look for resistance close to $70.\n- **TQQQ:** Key support at approximately $49.50; resistance near $52.\n- **SOXL:** Watch support levels around $65; resistance at $70.\n\nIn conclusion, maintain a cautious but bullish stance on broadly diversified ETFs while being more defensive with tech-related ETFs."
