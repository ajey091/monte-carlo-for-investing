    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment appears mixed, with signs of caution in broad indices and selective sectors showing strength. Major ETFs like **VOO** and **QQQ** provide opposing signals, reflecting a divergence in performance across sectors. Meanwhile, leveraged ETFs such as **UPRO**, **QLD**, and **TQQQ** show bearish signals, indicating potential downward pressure. In contrast, some other leveraged ETFs like **SOXL** exhibit bullish characteristics, suggesting sector-specific resilience.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Maintain positions but monitor closely; the bullish MA cross indicates potential for upward movement, although the RSI suggests a neutral stance.\n\n- **SSO (S&P 500 Double Long ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Continue holding, but as with VOO, be cautious; the bullish cross denotes a chance for recovery, but the low RSI warrants vigilance.\n\n- **UPRO (S&P 500 3x leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Hold current positions; the bullish indicators suggest potential for growth, despite lower RSI values.\n\n- **QQQ (NASDAQ-100 ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** Consider exiting positions; the bearish MA cross and declining RSI reflect weakness in tech-heavy sectors.\n\n- **QLD (NASDAQ-100 Double Long ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** Recommend selling; bearish indicators highlight the potential for further declines.\n\n- **TQQQ (NASDAQ-100 3x leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** SELL\n  - **Recommendation:** Exit positions; the bearish trend indicates significant downside risk.\n\n- **SOXL (Semiconductor 3x leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal:** HOLD\n  - **Recommendation:** Maintain position; the bullish MA cross and higher RSI suggest strength in the semiconductor sector, despite overall market caution.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings if Applicable\nInvestors should be aware of the following risks:\n- **Market Volatility:** The low volatility indicators across most ETFs suggest a current low-risk environment; however, conditions can shift rapidly.\n- **Leveraged ETFs Risk:** Leveraged ETFs like **TQQQ**, **QLD**, and **UPRO** can magnify losses, especially when markets are trending downward. Regular monitoring and a risk management strategy are crucial.\n- **Sector Specific Risks:** While some sectors show resilience (e.g., **SOXL**), this could change if broader market conditions deteriorate.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO:** Watch for resistance near the 635 levels; support levels are at approximately 630.\n- **QQQ:** Key support is found around 605; if this breaks, further declines may ensue.\n- **UPRO and SSO:** Monitor closely around the 117 level and 58 level, respectively; a breach of these levels could indicate stronger downward trends.\n- **TQQQ and QLD:** Significant levels to watch are around 50 and 70, respectively, as breaking these may signal further selling pressure.\n- **SOXL:** Should maintain above 65 to confirm bullish trends; a drop below this could signal potential weakness.\n\nIn summary, market participants should navigate this mixed landscape with caution, adopting a selective approach to their ETF holdings while paying close attention to prevailing market signals."
