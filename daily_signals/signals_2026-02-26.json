    "summary": "### 1. Overall Market Sentiment\nAs of February 25, 2026, the market sentiment appears mixed based on the trading signals for various ETFs. Major index ETFs like VOO (S&P 500) and leveraged ETFs connected to it (SSO and UPRO) indicate stability with \"HOLD\" signals, while tech-focused ETFs (QQQ, QLD, TQQQ) show bearish trends and recommend \"SELL.\" This suggests a potential rotation away from technology stocks and a preference for broader market exposure.\n\n### 2. Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n- **VOO (S&P 500 ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Action**: Continue holding as there are bullish indicators (MA cross) and stable RSI. Monitor closely for any change in momentum.\n\n- **SSO (S&P 500 2x Leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Action**: Like VOO, maintain your position due to bullish signs. Risk is lower due to low volatility.\n\n- **UPRO (S&P 500 3x Leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Action**: Suggest holding, but keep an eye on volatility as it is higher than VOO and SSO. \n\n- **QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL\n  - **Action**: Consider selling or reducing exposure due to bearish signals indicating potential further downside.\n\n- **QLD (Nasdaq-100 2x Leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL\n  - **Action**: Exit or reduce holdings, as bearish momentum is confirmed.\n\n- **TQQQ (Nasdaq-100 3x Leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: SELL\n  - **Action**: Exit positions due to strong bearish signals. High risk sensitivity due to leverage demands caution.\n\n- **SOXL (Semiconductor 3x Leveraged ETF)**\n  - **Signal**: HOLD\n  - **Action**: Maintain your position, as this ETF currently shows strong momentum with a bullish MA cross and higher RSI compared to others.\n\n### 3. Risk Warnings\n- **Diversification**: There\u2019s a clear market divergence between sectors. If heavily invested in tech (QQQ, QLD, TQQQ), consider diversifying into more stable sectors.\n- **Leverage Effects**: The leveraged ETFs can amplify both gains and losses. The sell signals in the leveraged tech ETFs indicate significant bearish sentiment that could lead to considerable losses if not managed carefully.\n- **Volatility**: Pay attention to the increasing volatility in tech and leveraged ETFs, particularly those associated with Nasdaq (QQQ, QLD, TQQQ), indicating a shift in market sentiment.\n\n### 4. Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO**: Watch for a breakout above the $640 level for bullish momentum; support around $631.\n- **QQQ**: Watching $620 as critical support, a breach below could lead to more downside.\n- **SSO/UPRO**: Key to hold above $59 for SSO and $119 for UPRO. Close monitoring of these levels could provide entry or exit signals.\n- **QLD/TQQQ**: Keep a close watch at $70 for QLD and $52 for TQQQ. Breaching these levels could provide further indicators for selling.\n\n### Conclusion\nMarket outlook is mixed, with stability in broader markets while tech faces bearish pressure. Given the current signals, a cautious approach emphasizing diversification and monitoring critical support levels is recommended."
