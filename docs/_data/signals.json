    "summary": "### Market Analysis Summary\n\n1. **Overall Market Sentiment:**\n   The current signals across the ETFs indicate a mixed to slightly cautious sentiment. Most ETFs\u2014including VOO, SSO, UPRO, QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ\u2014are on a HOLD signal despite the presence of bullish MA cross indicators. They are trading below their short-term moving averages, suggesting potential weakness. Conversely, SOXL presents a SELL signal, indicating the potential for a downward trend.\n\n2. **Specific Recommendations for Each ETF:**\n   - **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF):** HOLD. Monitor for a breakout above $545.61 (short MA). A strong move might provide an opportunity to enter a long position.\n   - **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500):** HOLD. Similar to VOO, focus on approaching the short-term MA ($95.43). A confirmed break could indicate a potential buy.\n   - **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P 500):** HOLD. Focus on $93.20, the short-term moving average. Strong performance above this level can be a signal to reevaluate position.\n   - **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust):** HOLD. Critical to watch the $513.67 level (short MA). Positive price movement above this can indicate willingness to take on risk.\n   - **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ):** HOLD. Maintain a position while monitoring price action near $110.07 (short MA). \n   - **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ):** HOLD. Watch for resistance at $81.63. It may offer an opportunity if broken convincingly.\n   - **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares):** SELL. This suggests an exit position. Current price action reflects a bearish phase and may continue trending lower.\n\n3. **Risk Warnings:**\n   - For all holdings categorized as HOLD, the general market weakness indicated by the moving averages and momentum measures should be closely monitored. The presence of lower volatility suggests a potential for sudden moves should external market factors shift.\n   - SOXL is more volatile, moving with increased beta and could lead to losses in the case further bearish activity unfolds.\n   - Leveraged ETFs, especially, magnify losses; therefore, investors should be cautious with exposure levels.\n\n4. **Key Levels to Watch:**\n   - **Resistance Levels:**\n     - VOO: $545.61\n     - SSO: $95.43\n     - UPRO: $93.20\n     - QQQ: $513.67\n     - QLD: $110.07\n     - TQQQ: $81.63\n   - **Support Levels:**\n     - Track for substantial support below current prices; especially in the case of SOXL, where a continued trend downturn could suggest watching $28.00 closely for signals of recovery or further decline.\n\nOverall, while many equities display a bullish MA cross, their current positions relative to indicators and price action suggest a cautious approach with a preference toward HOLDing positions, especially in leveraged ETFs."
