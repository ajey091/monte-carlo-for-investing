    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish based on the trading signals across major ETFs and leveraged ETFs analyzed. All provided ETFs are issuing \"SELL\" signals, coinciding with bearish moving average crossovers and rising RSI values indicating overbought conditions, though classified as neutral. The overall low volatility suggests the market is not experiencing significant fluctuations, but the consistent \"SELL\" signals indicate a potential price correction or pullback could be imminent.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n\n1. **VOO**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider exiting positions or implementing stop-loss orders to protect against potential downside.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance at close price of 546; support at approximately 508 (MA short).\n\n2. **SSO**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Initiate or increase protective measures (stop-loss) to safeguard gains.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance near 90.81; support at approximately 80 (MA short).\n\n3. **UPRO**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Exit or hedge long positions as the momentum may shift negatively.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance near 82.29; support at 69.37 (MA short).\n\n4. **QQQ**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Protect existing gains; consider reducing exposure.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance at 521.51; support around 472.63 (MA short).\n\n5. **QLD**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Plan for exit to avoid potential declines.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance near 106.06; support at 88.98 (MA short).\n\n6. **TQQQ**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Exit positions to secure profits; cautious approach recommended.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance at 71.45; support at 56.34 (MA short).\n\n7. **SOXL**\n   - **Signal**: SELL\n   - **Recommendation**: Reduce exposure and consider protective positioning.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch**: Resistance near 18.39; support at 14.48 (MA short).\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Overbought Conditions**: The RSI values are above 70 for most ETFs, indicating potential for price corrections. This suggests that any long positions may be risky.\n- **Market Volatility**: Although current volatility is low, the potential for abrupt market shifts should not be ignored, especially in leveraged ETFs like UPRO, TQQQ, and SOXL which may amplify losses in a downturn.\n- **Interest Rate and Economic Factors**: Monitor macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic data that could intensify bearish movements unexpectedly.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **Resistance Levels**: Identify and monitor resistance prices for potential short-term rebound opportunities (near current close prices for each ETF).\n- **Support Levels**: Pay attention to moving average levels as crucial support points where the price could stabilize, particularly MA short values, which can trigger buying opportunities if they hold.\n\nIn summary, be cautious with existing long positions and consider action to safeguard investments amidst bearish trends, as indicated by current market analysis."
