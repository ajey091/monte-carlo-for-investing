    "summary": "### Overall Market Sentiment\nThe current market sentiment is bearish across multiple ETFs, as indicated by 'SELL' signals for both standard and leveraged ETFs. All tracked instruments show bearish moving average crosses, with relatively low RSI indicators suggesting the market is under pressure but not deeply oversold. Volatility levels are generally low, potentially pointing to a consolidating market, yet the bearish trend indicates a lack of momentum for upward movement.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Each ETF\n1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell, as all indicators point to a continued downtrend.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around $525 (short MA) and $530 (long MA).\n\n2. **SSO (ProShares Ultra S&P500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. The leveraged nature of this ETF amplifies exposure to losses.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $87 (short MA) and $89 (long MA).\n\n3. **UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&P500 ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. This leveraged ETF poses a higher risk due to the downtrend.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at around $80 (short MA) and $83 (long MA).\n\n4. **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. The bearish trend is clear, particularly in tech.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance levels at $490 (short MA) and $496 (long MA).\n\n5. **QLD (ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. Similar to other leveraged ETFs, it carries enhanced risk during downturns.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at approximately $98 (short MA) and $101 (long MA).\n\n6. **TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. High risk due to leverage; consider exiting positions.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance at $67 (short MA) and $70 (long MA).\n\n7. **SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X ETF)**\n   - **Recommendation:** Sell. The oversold RSI indicates potential for recovery, but current signals are bearish.\n   - **Key Levels to Watch:** Resistance around $20 (short MA) and $22 (long MA).\n\n### Risk Warnings\n- **Leveraged ETFs:** Investing in leveraged ETFs, like SSO, UPRO, QLD, TQQQ, and SOXL, is inherently riskier, especially in a declining market. Losses can be amplified, leading to swifter erosion of capital. Investors should exercise caution and consider the potential for volatile swings in performance.\n\n### Key Levels to Watch\n- **VOO:** $525 (Resistance 1), $530 (Resistance 2)\n- **SSO:** $87 (Resistance 1), $89 (Resistance 2)\n- **UPRO:** $80 (Resistance 1), $83 (Resistance 2)\n- **QQQ:** $490 (Resistance 1), $496 (Resistance 2)\n- **QLD:** $98 (Resistance 1), $101 (Resistance 2)\n- **TQQQ:** $67 (Resistance 1), $70 (Resistance 2)\n- **SOXL:** $20 (Resistance 1), $22 (Resistance 2)\n\nIn conclusion, a cautious approach is warranted, with a preference for selling positions in both standard and leveraged ETFs, given prevailing bearish signals and technical indicators."
